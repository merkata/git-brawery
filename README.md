# Git for the Brave and Bold
A short introduction to git, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise

## What is git?

Git is a version control system. It is best used for simple text, meaning configuration files, source code, some touchy poetry and all else clear text.

It can work with binaries and other formats, you have git-lfs or Git Large-File-Storage, but git shines when it comes to text, we'll see how.

Git was developed by Linus Torvalds to better suit the development of the Linux kernel. It was hosted on a proprietary version control platform until 2005, but the company built a paywall around the service (quite ironic when thinking about the Open Source Linux kernel..)

When using git, you know who has done a change on a set of text, when was it done, what where the changes before that. You cn even jump back in time, refer to an older version of the text, start a whole different piece of text based on that historical set.

Git is decentralized, so unlike CVS and Subversion, you get to work alone (don't cry), but you can rapidly share your changes with colleagues and other like minded people without the need of a specialized server somewhere, if you're point A and your developer friend is point B, you don't need an intermittent point.

Git can also be used for centralized colaboration, where you don't need to send the updated version of a document across half the company, the updated document can reside on one place with all the historical changes (and older versions) kept safe for generations to come.
